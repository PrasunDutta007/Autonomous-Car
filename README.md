# Autonomous Car (Raspberry Pi)

<img src="Screenshots/car.gif" width="100%">



## Requirements 

#### 1) Raspberry Pi 3B+
#### 2) L298N Motor Driver Module
#### 3) HC-SR04 Ultra Sonic Sensor
#### 4) 300 RPM DC Motor
#### 5) Car Chassis
#### 6) Wheels
#### 7) 12V Battery 



## Working Module - Raspberry Pi 3B+ 

### Pins Used
    1) 2 Ã— 5-volt supply pins
    2) 2 Ã— ground pins
    3) GPIO PIN 18
    4) GPIO PIN 23
    5) GPIO PIN 24
    6) GPIO PIN 25
    7) GPIO PIN 21
    8) GPIO PIN 26

### Connections 
    i) The 5-volt power supply with supply power to the logic boards of L298N and HCSR04.
    ii) The ground pins are used to complete the circuit of the supply pins
    iii) GPIO pins 18 and 23 are used to control the logic input pins 1 and 2 of the L298N
        which controls the forward and backward movement of the right motor.
    iv) GPIO pins 24 and 25 are used to control the logic input pins 3 and 4 of the L298N
        which controls the forward and backward movement of the left motor.
    v) GPIO pin 21 is used to set trigger the HS-SR04 which then activates itself to use its
        SONAR capabilities
    vi) GPIO pin 26 is a input pin which receives input from the HS-SR04 to get the time
        given by ultrasound ranging.

## Coding Module

Check the `Mini Project (Autonomous Car).pdf` documentation to get started.



  
## ðŸš€ Project in Progress.......

This Project requires further upgradation (in terms of components and code) to make it completely autonomous
using OpenCV. 

Our Final Model will look somewhat similar to this :point_down:
